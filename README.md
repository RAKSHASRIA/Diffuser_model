# Text-to-Video with Diffusers

This project uses Hugging Face's **Diffusers** library to generate video from text prompts. By providing a text description, the model generates a sequence of frames, which are then compiled into a video. The system leverages **Stable Diffusion** and other diffusion models to create realistic video content based on your text inputs.

## Features
- üé¨ **Text-to-Video Generation**: Generate videos from text prompts.
- üñºÔ∏è **High-Quality Frames**: Each frame is generated using a powerful diffusion model.
- üé• **Export to Video**: Frames are compiled into a video file.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Custom Video Duration**: Control the length of the generated video by adjusting the number of frames.
  
## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- **`diffusers`**: For generating video frames using diffusion models.
- **`transformers`**: For text processing and tokenization.
- **`Pillow`**: For image manipulation and frame conversion.
- **`imageio`**: For creating and exporting videos from generated frames.
- **`numpy`**: For numerical operations on arrays (handling frames).
- **`loguru`** (optional): For logging and debugging.
- **`torch` or `tensorflow`**: For model inference (PyTorch preferred for Hugging Face models).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
* Clone this repository to your local machine or Google Colab.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-video-diffusers.git
cd text-to-video-diffusers
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
* Ensure that Python is installed, and then install the required libraries.

```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* This will install the necessary libraries to run the project.
### 3. Generate Video from Text
* Run the Python script to generate a video based on your text prompt.
```bash
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import imageio
```
## Load the model
```bash
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4")
```

## Function to generate video from a text prompt
```bash
def generate_video(prompt, video_duration_seconds):
    num_frames = video_duration_seconds * 10  # 10 frames per second
    video_frames = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=25, num_frames=num_frames).frames
    
    # Convert frames to RGB format
    video_frames_rgb = [Image.fromarray(frame).convert("RGB") for frame in video_frames]
    
    # Save frames as a video
    video_path = "output_video.mp4"
    with imageio.get_writer(video_path, fps=10) as writer:
        for frame in video_frames_rgb:
            writer.append_data(np.array(frame))
    
    return video_path

## Example Usage
```python
prompt = "A cat riding a skateboard"
video_duration_seconds = 5
video_path = generate_video(prompt, video_duration_seconds)
print(f"Video saved to: {video_path}")
```
### 4. Output
* After running the script, the generated video will be saved to the file output_video.mp4 in your working directory.

How It Works
Text Input: The user provides a text prompt describing the desired video.
Frame Generation: The model (based on Stable Diffusion or similar) generates individual frames for the video based on the prompt.
Video Creation: The frames are combined into a video using imageio and exported as an .mp4 file.
Exported Video: The final video is saved to the disk and can be played or shared.
Example Prompts
Here are a few example prompts you can try:

"A futuristic city at sunset"
"A dog playing fetch in the park"
"A spaceship flying through the stars"
"A cat riding a skateboard"
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while generating the video, try the following:

Check Model Load: Ensure that the model is properly loaded from Hugging Face.
Check Video Duration: Make sure the video duration is within reasonable limits (e.g., don't request a video with too many frames).
Error Messages: If an error occurs during frame generation, review the error message for clues (e.g., missing dependencies, model errors).
Optional Improvements
üõ†Ô∏è Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the diffusion model on custom datasets for more specific video content.
üßë‚Äçüíª Web Interface: Integrate the script with a web interface (e.g., Streamlit or Gradio) for easier use.
üöÄ Optimization: Implement optimizations to speed up frame generation and video creation (e.g., batch processing).
